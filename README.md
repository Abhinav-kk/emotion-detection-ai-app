### Samsung Innovation Campus 2024 Capstone Project
Group 12 Innov8

## Motivation
Emotion recognition can be a valuable tool for enhancing both human and machine understanding of emotional states, aiding in fields such as mental health diagnostics, where understanding non-verbal cues is critical. The ability to recognize emotions accurately could also improve customer interactions in automated services by making responses more empathetic.

## Objective
To develop a high-accuracy CNN model that can recognize and categorize a range of emotions from facial expressions in real time, deployable in a web application. This application will allow users to upload images and receive emotion classifications, bridging the gap between advanced AI models and accessible, practical tools for various applications.
